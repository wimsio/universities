We are welcoming you all here. This repository is for source code from/for students of different universities/colleges, for the catalyst project : **Onboard Tertiary IT Students targeting 16 universities Globally : 1300148**

## D: Survey Haskell Plutus : June 2025 
### Enrollment 
The respondents who effectively enrolled accounted for 97%. This is helpful because the survey was aimed at uncovering their problems.

### Onchain Progress Tokens
The graph shows that the majority of students had 5+ onchain CNFT tokens

From the graph problems that stood out and needed attention were: Understanding Haskell Content(30%), App usability problem(22%), Ada faucet problems(20%), Enrollment difficulties(23%), Resource Challenges(17%), Problems with Cardano wallets(13%),Timezones(13%)

### Solutions

- This was solve by employing full time facilitators (11) who are available daily and have established 11 different groups. Live sessions are helping a lot.
- The App has undergone great upgrades: it is now running on all devices(cross platforms), comes with Coxy Wallet which comes with 1 prefunded address, easy and quick to create and simply uses a pass phrase - hiding the complexity of mnemonics management. See the image below

- Timezones were solved by having 3 timezones running daily -8 to -4, -4 to 0, +1 to +4 UTC
This shows that problems have been drastically minimized.

### Skills Gained

Haskell Basics(93%), Use of AI(63%), Logical Reasoning(67%), Problem Solving(67%), Communication(67%), Teamwork(53%). This shows that the project is benefitting participants and is 
giving students a positive experience. What is important is make this long term.
