Milestone 3 Quiz Survey 2025

The purpose of this survey is to have a post catalyst funding improvements, to assess how and why this programme mattered a lot to those who attended it. The 
enrollment keeps going up and new students keep starting Haskell Plutus. There is a need to make this grow bigger with or without Catalyst funding because it has lots of benefits.

Now we will look at the questions and answers:

1. Total Number of respondents 44.

   Although the project faced problems of Oct, Nov and Dec tertiary activities like assignments, examinations and schools closing attendance declined and still
   we had 44 students who responded to the survey.

2. EBU Registered 75%

   One of the key value of the programme is partnership with EBU, enabling students to be certified in Plutus Haskell. This assist in making us see insights
   into the programme.

3. Online Classes Groups Responded

   Many groups do exist from G001 up to G042.  Most respondents came from group G08 up to G037.

4. Coxygen Global Rating Positive

   5/5 positive rating received 56.8% and 4/5 positive ratings received 34.1%. This totals to 90.9% positive evaluation of the Coxygen Global company that
   ran the programme.

   These ratings are positive and we will cross check them with the productivity: Actual Plutus Haskell created applications : a) Facilitation            Sessions, b) Skills gained by doing this course, c) App used (Coxygen Global Dapp), d) Remote training,
   e) How useful is this in your life, f) Haskell Plutus technologies/languages, g) Technical support
