Milestone 3 Quiz Survey 2025

The purpose of this survey is to have a post catalyst funding improvements, to assess how and why this programme mattered a lot to those who attended it. The 
enrollment keeps going up and new students keep starting Haskell Plutus. There is a need to make this grow bigger with or without Catalyst funding because it has lots of benefits.

Now we will look at the questions and answers:

1. Total Number of respondents 44.

   Although the project faced problems of Oct, Nov and Dec tertiary activities like assignments, examinations and schools closing attendance declined and still
   we had 44 students who responded to the survey.

2. EBU Registered 75%

   One of the key value of the programme is partnership with EBU, enabling students to be certified in Plutus Haskell. This assist in making us see insights
   into the programme.

3. Online Classes Groups Responded

   Many groups do exist from G001 up to G042.  Most respondents came from group G08 up to G037.

4. Coxygen Global Rating Positive

   <img width="844" height="548" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a78aad19-8962-41d5-af4e-f0c4458c860a" />

   5/5 positive rating received 56.8% and 4/5 positive ratings received 34.1%. This totals to 90.9% positive evaluation of the Coxygen Global company that
   ran the programme.

5. Ratings of Activities

   These ratings are positive and we will cross check them with the productivity: Actual Plutus Haskell created applications : a) Facilitation            Sessions, b) Skills gained by doing this course, c) App used (Coxygen Global Dapp), d) Remote training,
   e) How useful is this in your life, f) Haskell Plutus technologies/languages, g) Technical support

6. Skill and responsiveness of the instructor

* Instructor was effective
* Facilitators
* Teamwork
* Communication
* Problem-solving
* Networking with others from other countries
* Progress in your career

The graphs below show indepth views of respondents on the 7 areas of the programme. This shows that this was not just a simple quick onboardment event but qualitative process to grow Cardano, Catalyst and also to grow participants: students. The coding skills and certificates from EBU will in future assist and influence them in their careers one way or another. When looking at this, one is sees the need to grow Coxygen Global into a fully fleshed Cardano Training Online University offering educational services on all different areas: CBCA, Catalyst Training, Intersect Training, CS research and training.  The graphs do show how students and Cardano benefit from this.

7. Plutus Haskell Content(Videos, Translations, Tutorials, etc)

   <img width="854" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b675384c-687e-4f25-9d07-24d0fb40afdf" />

   Cardano uses Haskell which is an academic programming language influenced by Mathematics and it is no surprise to see huges numbers getting in
   and few students surviving. This programme was and is diverse, inclusive, has zero entry barriers. It is interesting to see students grow from zero    to hero : Students never know about Cardano, were never screened through aptitude tests or via recruitment interviews. But this is amazing to note     that started and completed 12 with the training of Haskell Plutus. Expanding this to other critical areas of Cardano is inevitable: Other
   programming languages like Aiken, Helios, Plu-ts, Lucid, Mesh, etc and other courses like CBCA.

8. What aspects of this course were most useful or valuable?

   The actual responses are amazing and make me feel, it was tough but worthy it. Here is a polished summary:

* Haskell and Plutus: Learning Haskell and its connection to smart contracts (Plutus), with Plutus noted as the most useful part
* Practical application and sessions: Practical tasks, live coding, hands-on sessions (building a website, minting tokens)
* Course materials and structure: Lesson notes, tutorials, and course outline were helpful; some preferred written material over videos
* Community and support: Facilitator step-by-step breakdowns, the WhatsApp community, and the idea of daily support sessions
* Collaboration and real-world experience: Working with people from different countries, meeting deadlines, accountability, and teamwork
* Specific concepts: Functional programming concepts, Haskell syntax, and Plutus specifics (e.g., PlutusTx for on-chain code)

   Since many things can be faked, you are invited to view actual responses and also to connect and speak to the students themselves.
  
9. How would you improve this course?

* Practical application and coding: More coding sessions, early hands-on “build something small” tasks, real-world projects, a small project at the     end of each lesson, and practical real-world examples
* Communication and support: Fewer general WhatsApp messages with structured weekly summaries, provide recordings/recap notes after sessions, offer
  end-to-end coaching (on-chain and off-chain), plus debugging and testing tips
* Platform and accessibility: Make the platform more user-friendly, fix website usability issues, and improve accessibility
* Content and structure: Reduce technical terms at the beginning, add more tutorials, and consider increasing duration (more hours)
* Quality and commitment: Ensure qualified facilitators/instructors, and encourage continuous learning and commitment from participants

  From 2026, we will see to it that we do improve on the requested features in section 9. We want to even make it self sustaining.

10. Why did you choose this course?

* Skill acquisition and learning: Learn Haskell and Plutus, gain new technical skills, and understand the Cardano ecosystem and smart contracts
* Career and professional development: Career growth, becoming a better developer, improving competitiveness, and opening opportunities
   (e.g., WIL/EBU, future remote work)
* Interest in blockchain and Web3: Passion for blockchain, Web3 development, and functional programming (Haskell/Plutus)
* Program benefits: Free and online-based, making it accessible and appealing to try

11. Would you recommend a friend to join Haskell Plutus?
